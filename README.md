# CAPSTONE-ML-Project-2

# Problem Background

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) which administers the major government health programs in the U.S. This includes insurance programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CMS also plays an important role in collecting and analyzing data with the goal of improving efficiency and equity in the healthcare system. In the current project, you will be analyzing CMS data on hospital quality.  

CMS rates hospitals in the U.S. on a scale of 1-5, with the objective of making it easier for patients and consumers to compare the quality of services offered by hospitals. CMS conducts surveys each year and keeps on updating the ratings to reflect the current services being delivered by each of the hospitals.

The ratings directly influence the choice of hospitals made by consumers and may significantly impact hospitals' revenues. This project is focused on developing an approach to calculate hospital ratings and using it to identify areas of improvement for hospitals.

# Problem Statement

You are working as a consultant for a non-profit organization in the US that provides recommendations to hospitals on areas they need to improve so that they can get a better rating from CMS. This would affect the overall hospital revenue as well as improve the quality of life for the patients. Also, for hospitals that are yet to be rated, you can pre-emptively help them by providing a tentative rating based on their current services and suggesting where they need to invest more in improvement.
